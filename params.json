To what extent can criminal history (type and number of cases) be used to predict victory?\r\n2. What is the level of asset accumulation for a member of parliament while in office?\r\n3. Do firms that are partly owned by members of parliament do better than others?\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe contributors are all students of the MPA/ID 2016 program at Harvard Kennedy School.\r\nMembers are: @anneshrestha, @matiascuadra, @martinkess\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease email committedgits@gmail.com for any questions","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
